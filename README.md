Overview:
This project is a Tiny BASIC to C Compiler that translates code written in the Tiny BASIC language into equivalent C code. 
The compiler is composed of three main components: a lexer, a parser, and an emitter, which work together to analyze the input code, understand its structure, and generate corresponding C code.

Features
Lexer: Tokenizes the Tiny BASIC source code into meaningful symbols for the parser to process.
Parser: Analyzes the structure of the Tiny BASIC code and ensures it adheres to the languageâ€™s syntax.
Emitter: Generates clean and efficient C code based on the parsed Tiny BASIC code.
